# Multiplayer Snake Experiment

This multiplayer snake game was built to try out canvas, node.js with websockets, and coffeescript.

You can see a socket.io based version in action at [http://snake.9elements.com/](http://snake.9elements.com/), but you should use Chrome or Safari to view it...

You are currently viewing the socket.io based branch. The project was converted to make hosting on Nodester easier / possible. To see it in action, please click the url above. For local testing or own experiments, I recommend using the current master, since it's a bit cleaner.
